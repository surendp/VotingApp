### Voting App

 This app is a mini project created based on the tutorial given by www.fullstackreact.io for learning react.

### Functionality

- Display the Sorted List of product
- Click the up-vote icon to vote the product

### Outcome

This project helped me to learn following skills:

- Create data driven and stateful React components using JSX
- Understanding Event propagation, Event handeling and binding custom component methods
- Use of lifecycle methods. For example: componentDidMount method to populate the state
- Immutable manipulation of the state.

- Understanding ES6 arrow functions including JavaScript map() and sort() functions

- Use of babel to convert ES6 code to ES5 browser compatible JavaScript code
- Use of babel transform-class-properties plugin to refactor the components implementing property initializers syntax in react components
